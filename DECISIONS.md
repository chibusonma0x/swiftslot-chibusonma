# SWIFTSLOT - Design & Implementation Decisions
## Summary

The architecture prioritizes correctness of core booking logic (preventing double-bookings) and proper timezone handling over production scalability concerns. The database-level unique constraints provide bulletproof conflict prevention, while the timezone conversion strategy ensures consistent time handling across UI, API, and database layers. All design decisions were made to meet the specific assessment requirements while maintaining code clarity and demonstrating key concepts effectively.
